# Surl

My first [SailsJS](http://sailsjs.org/) project, an url shortener, built to understand something more about this nice framework.

## Install

* Clone the repo;
* `npm install`;
* `sails lift`;
* Profit;

### Project History

* 1st Commit | Apr 25, 2016 | 09:30
    * Playing with the really basics of the framework (routing, controller, views, models);
    * Anyone can use the app to create a short version of a certain url (using shortid);
    * Once created a short version and got an id, you can browse to `hostname/redirect/ID` to be redirected on the target site;
